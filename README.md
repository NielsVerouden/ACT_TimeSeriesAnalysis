# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!).  Thank you to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Flood risk assessment using time series analysis

## Description
In recent years, climate change has become an important factor for conflict. 
Since the Dutch Ministry of Defence strives for a world of freedom and security, getting insight into flooding is highly valuable to the Ministry for proper planning of operations. 
Therefore, the main objective of this project is to create a globally applicable time series analysis method which analyses the spatial and temporal patterns of flood prone areas. 
Even though the analysis should work on a global scale, the project focuses on three different study areas. 
Ordered by their priority, these are 1). Haiti, 2). Suriname, and 3). Chad. 

This project explores opportunities and possibilities of applying remote sensing techniques to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to create a methodology of time series analysis for flood risk assessment. 
Since flood events are often characterised by persistent cloud cover, SAR data is used in our project since clouds do not obstruct radar signals. 
Hence, the analysis solely relies on Sentinel-1 data since this satellite captures SAR data on a global scale. 
Besides, a simple thresholding classifications is used to create flood frequency maps of the selected study areas. 
The outcome of this method consists of maps displaying the frequency of flooding, as well as a workflow report of the time series analysis. 
The team will use the MoSCoW method to assign four levels of priority to the different products defined in our project. 

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
The five authors of this project are: Mark Boeve (manager), Julia Sipkema (controller), Jakko-Jan van Ek (secretary), Raimon Barch Pareja (team-member) and Niels Verouden (team-member). 

A special thanks to Stefan, our commissioner, Sytze, our coach, and Dainius, our expert, for helping and guiding us throughout the project. 

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
